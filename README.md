# Tent-map

This is a repository in which tent map is studied.

A study is made of the function, the parameters that produce significant dynamics, fixed points and their stability, graphs with relevant dynamics, cobweb graphs with different regimes, stability points in the second generation, the bifurcation diagram (Tent_map_biff.py) and a Lyapunov exponent diagram (tent_map_Lyapunov_exponent.py).
